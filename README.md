### This project is created using reactjs. Make sure that nodejs and mongodb is installed. I have used mongodb compass to store the images in the database.</br>
first clone the project, than type: </br>
> npm install </br>
> nodemon app.js </br>

<a href="http://localhost:5000/">Visit localhost:5000</a>
